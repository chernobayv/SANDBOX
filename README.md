# SANDBOX
My final project for my SAP d-shop coop!

During my internship at the SAP d-shop, I developed Sandbox, a specialized platform designed to bridge the gap between high school students and professional opportunities. The platform features a streamlined submission process where users contribute internships via an integrated form. To ensure data integrity, I implemented a backend call to ChatGPT that automatically verifies information and generates professional descriptions before publishing listings to the live page. This project allowed me to integrate LLM technology into a functional web ecosystem, building on my experience with AI and cloud technologies.

The development followed a professional pipeline, starting with a detailed Figma wireframe to map the user experience, followed by deployment using HTML/CSS and SAP website creation software. For the final presentation, I utilized Blender for custom animations and Canva for visual storytelling. I had the privilege of presenting the platform to high-level SAP executives and at the TDSB Teachers Conference, the largest school board conference in the province.
